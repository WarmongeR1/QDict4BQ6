<h4>Abba [A]</h4>

Yeshua uses “<i>Amen</i>” to refer back, either seriously or ironically, to what he or someone else has said, or to what has just happened. Mt 5:18+. (2) Occasionally the term indicates to the congregation to say “<i>Amen</i>” at the end of a prayer. Mt 6:13+.

As used among English-speaking Jews <i>Goyim</i> means “Non-Jews”, i.e., those outside “our group”; as with all words employed in this way, it can have a positive, a neutral or a negative connotation, depending on the speaker and the situation. In the <i> Jewish New Testament</i>, to avoid suggesting exclusivist overtones when the text does not intend them, the word is used rather rarely to translate <i> ethnos</i> and then only when God is speaking or when a Jew is addressing other Jews.

However, Greek <i>armageddon</i> could be rendering Har Migdo (“hill of his glory”), in which case it refers to Mount Tziyon in Yerushalayim. Rv 16:9.

<h4>Natzrati</h4>
<p><i>Natzra</i><b><i>ti</i></b> (Nazarene), pl. <i>Natzratim</i>—In regard to Mattityahu, the <i>Tanakh</i> nowhere says that the Messiah is to be called a <i> Natzrati</i>, but Isaiah 11:2 refers to him as a <i>netzer</i> (“branch, shoot”). Since <i>Natzrati</i> means “resident of Natzeret”, the name <i>Natzratim</i> (followers of the man from Natzeret) is given to the Jewish followers of Yeshua. Thus Mattityahu’s “fulfillment” apparently involves a word play, although other explanations have been offered. The modern Hebrew word for “Christian” is <i>Notzri</i>, a variant of <i>Natzrati</i>.

When the Temple was destroyed in 70 <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">c.e.</span>, the <i>P’rushim</i> were in a position to develop their tradition into the basis for Jewish life everywhere; this tradition is the core of the <i> Talmud</i> and of modem religious Judaism.

<p><i>tal</i><b><i>mid</i></b>, fem. <i>talmi</i><b><i>dah</i></b>, pl. <i>talmi</i><b><i>dim</i></b>—disciple, student.

Hence, the Old Testament. Rendered “scripture” or “it is written” in most translations.

<h4>treif</h4>
<p><i>treif</i>—literally “torn”. Since meat torn by wild animals is forbidden under the Jewish dietary laws, <i>treif</i> means, by extension, “non-kosher” (“not fit” to be eaten by Jews). Ac 10:14+.
<h4>t’shuvah</h4>
<p><i>t’shu</i><b><i>vah</i></b>—literally, “turning”. In the context of behavior it means repentance, since the sinner who “does <i>t’shuvah</i>” is turning from sin to God. Mt 13:15+.

The <i>Tz’dukim</i> tended to be richer, more skeptical, more worldly, and more willing to cooperate with the Roman conquerors than the <i> P’rushim</i>.

In ancient times, including the first century, the <i> tallit</i> was a cloak or robe included in normal male attire. After clothes stopped being made with “corners”, Judaism created the modern <i>tallit</i> (prayer shawl) so that the <i>mitzvah</i> could be performed. Mt 9:20+.
<h4>Tziyon</h4>
<p>Tzi<b>yon</b> (Zion, Sion)—Mount Tziyon was originally the City of David, south of the modern Old City of Yerushalayim. Later the name Tziyon came to refer metaphorically to the Temple Mount, Yerushalayim, the people of Yerushalayim, or the people of Israel.

In the Septuagint and the New Testament the name was brought over into Greek as <i>I&ecirc;sous</i> and thence into English as “Jesus”. It means “<i>Y-H-V-H</i> saves” (Mt 1:21) and is also the masculine form of <i> yeshu'ah</i> (“salvation”). (1) The Messiah of Israel, Yeshua from Natzeret. In modern Hebrew Yeshua’s name is pronounced and written “<i>Yeshu</i>” , which may have been the ancient pronunciation in the Galil. However, reflecting two thousand years of conflict between the Church and the Synagogue, it is also an acronym for <i>Yimach sh’mo v’zikhrono</i> (“May his name and memory be blotted out”). Mt 1:1+. (2) A Messianic Jew in Rome, “Yeshua, the one called Justus.” Co 4:11.
